# The Zebra Take Home Assignment - Daniel Pericich

## The Goal

Translate mockup and mock API call provided with assignment into working price comparison tool.

## Technologies used

This app was bootstrapped using CRA (Create React App) and the npm node-sass package to utilize SCSS for component styling. For testing, I downloaded Enzyme and am using Enzyme with Jest to do unit testing for certain components.

## File Structure

The structure of this app is a the index.js file as the entry point, with the App.js serving as the main container for all rendered components. All images are stored in the assets directory on the top level of the project. All components are stored in their own directories in the components top level directory. Components as well as their test files are stored in the components folders, as all styling is stored in the sass top level styling directory. Here I utilize the 7-1 SASS architecture approach for my styling files.

## How to use

Clone this repository onto your machine and run "npm install" from the terminal. This will install all dependencies for the project.
